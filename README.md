# YouTube_Web_Data_Scrape
Python code to scrape L. Gherani's YouTube Channel to create an Excel document that captures the Title and links to her videos.

# BACKGROUND
She is the founder of XelPlus, and the focus of her YouTube Channel is to help viewers master Data Analysis with Excel & Power BI. Her videos are helpful if you want a quick tutorial on a particular topic.  I wanted a handy list of all her videos so that I could search for my given topics and access the video link from that document. I used ChatGPT to help me write the code to complete this task. 

# Included in this Repo
Python code to navigate to the YouTube site, scrape and extract the video titles and links to an Excel document saved on my shared drive. 

# Up Next
Next on my list is automating the process to automatically capture her new content.
